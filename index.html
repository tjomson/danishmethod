        <p>
            <b>A. Personally-Identifiable Information:</b><br/>
            Den Danske Metode typically receives specific data about its website visitors only when such information is provided voluntarily, such as when our visitors request information, purchase or enroll for services, open a customer support inquiry ticket, provide resume information for employment opportunities, or send us e-mail. Of course, some of these activities require that you give us information, such as when you make a purchase, use a credit card to pay for services, submit your resume, or request certain types of information. When you provide personally- identifiable information to Den Danske Metode through one of our websites, it will be used to fulfill your specific request. In most cases, you will be given the opportunity to select whether you do, or do not, want Den Danske Metode to use this information for additional purposes. You may also request that Den Danske Metode not use your information by sending an e-mail to: <u>support@Den Danske Metode</u> , however, Den Danske Metode reserves the right, in its discretion, to send you bulletins and other important information about your Den Danske Metode services. Absent any instructions from you, Den Danske Metode may use information you provide to inform you about additional services and products offered by the Den Danske Metode family of companies, Den Danske Metode authorized agents, and other goods and services providers with whom Den Danske Metode has relationships and whose offerings might be of interest to you. Den Danske Metode will not, however, sell or trade your personally-identifiable information unless we are authorized or legally required to do so, or in the case of imminent physical harm to the visitor or others. On those Den Danske Metode sites where you may provide Den Danske Metode with credit card or other ordering information via the web, Den Danske Metode protects and secures this information by employing commercially customary web- based security and encryption protocols, examples of which include Secure Socket Layer (SSL) and Secure Electronic Transaction (SET).
